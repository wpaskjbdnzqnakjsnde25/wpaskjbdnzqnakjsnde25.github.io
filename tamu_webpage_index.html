    <section id="Problem Statement">
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The main purpose of the paper was to survey children and speech-language pathologists (SLP) to examine the feasibility of using speech controlled wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde for speech therapy at home for extended durations. Speech therapies usually continue for a very long duration which make them very expensive and inconvenient to follow through, especially for children.</p> 

        <p>This means that usually children try different home remedies to replace these speech therapy sessions. But there are two main issues that come with it: firstly, these exercises are very monotonous and boring and require constant motivation to perform them. The second issue is that a parent has to be present every time the child performs one of these exercises to provide timely and accurate feedback which is essential in these exercises.</p>

        <p>The emergence of wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde which integrate automatic speech recognition (ASR) which let the user control the gameplay using their voice and different properties of voice such as the pitch solves both these issues simultaneously. The wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde are engaging enough to not bore children and simultaneously provide feedback on the user's speech through the gameplay. This makes them a very attractive alternative to extended speech therapies with a doctor.</p> 

        <p>Therefore, it was important to have a study that surveyed the impressions of these wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde on their target audience which would guide future research in this area.</p>

        <h3>Problem Solution</h3>

        <p>The study was conducted with the help of 10 children who were diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), which requires a lot of speech therapy. It also included 6 typically developing (TD) children and 7 SLP's. Feedback for five different wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde which used ASR was collected. The method of input was slightly different in all these wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde: all of them required a touch to initiate the recording of speech while three of them required another touch to stop the recording and the other two just recorded for a predefined time. The predefined time could be varied to change the difficulty of the game (a shorter time in which the user has to pronounce a word would make it harder). There were thirty 1-4 syllable words which were put in the game which the user had to pronounce during the game play. These words were chosen such that their pronunciation difficulty varied from easy to hard.</p>

        <p>All the participants were made to play all the five wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde in randomized order. They were required to play the game for 5 minutes and then answer a questionnaire which measured different parameters of the game such as ease of playing, the entertainment value of the game, etc. The researchers tried their best to have at least 15 word recordings per participant to have enough data for later analysis. The survey for each game was given immediately after the user played the game and then there was a 5 to 7 minute gap before the next game was given to the user.</p>

        <p>After the entire experiment the participants were asked to tell which game they liked the least and why. To measure the accuracy of ASR in the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde, the researcher present kept a count manually and used their best judgment as to whether the app was correct in categorizing the pronunciation as correct or wrong.</p>

    <section id="result">
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>There were two types of questions in the questionnaire: one type required the user to give a rating between one to five and the other type was more descriptive where the user had to write a short answer to the question.</p>

        <p>All the children in both the categories could play the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde without any additional instructions. The CAS group showed a strong preference for the Asteroids game, with more than 70% of the group saying that they liked that game the best. Interestingly, only 30% of the participants from the TD group gave it the “best game” rating. All the children were of the consensus that what they liked most about the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde was the challenge, the rewards and the entertainment value they provided. Some of the most common complaints regarding the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde were that they were either too difficult or too easy to play and that the ASR was inconsistent in recognizing the participants' pronunciation correctly.</p> 

        <p>The SLPs also felt that they could play all the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde without any additional help and enjoyed all the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde. They also like the same things about the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde that the children did. But SLPs disliked the game asteroids the most because it was hard to master the gameplay properly. Instead, the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde that they liked the most were Whack-A-Mole and Speechworm. They also liked the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde where the user was given multiple retries when ASR in the game failed to properly categorize the pronunciation. They thought that the best wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde that the children could use for speech therapy for extended durations were the ones which were fun and easy to play.</p>

    <section id="Critique">
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <p>The timing of the study was perfect since the idea of using ASR integrated with wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde for speech therapy was relatively new and the impressions provided by the participants will be valuable for future game designs.
    The questionnaire and the methodology were designed very carefully to get the maximum amount of information from the participants. Including SLPs in the participant pool was a good idea as it allowed the researchers to get more feedback on what the doctors thought were important features in the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde for the children to practice speech therapy.</p>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <p>There was little diversity in the ages of children - the study could have included children who were older also.</p> 
    Participants completed the survey only after 5 minutes of playing the game - since one of the purposes of the study was to find out if these wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde can be played for extended duration at home, it might have been better to conduct the study in a similar situation i.e the participants could have played the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde for a longer duration before completing the survey. Because there is a chance that any game which they liked in the beginning might end up becoming dull and boring after a while. This would have enabled researchers to identify those features of wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde which can enable users to play them for a longer period of time.</p>
    <p>The number of participants was very few - the study should have tried to include more participants which would make the results more concrete and diverse.
    The ASR did not function correctly at all times in all the wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde - this increased frustration among the participants and would have biased their opinion on the effectiveness of the game.</p>
