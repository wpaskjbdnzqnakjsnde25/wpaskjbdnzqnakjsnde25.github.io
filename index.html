                I am majoring in computer science for my masters. In the past few decades, this field has revolutionized human technology. Today, almost all other scientific fields rely on computers to make progress. People interact with computer systems almost every single second of their dwpaskjbdn zqnakjsndely life -  from making coffee to having remote meetings across the world for their work.

                It would not be an understatement to say that the entire world today is dependent on technologies like the internet. And the internet would not exist without computers and the decades of research that have gone into developing protocols which enable computers between different parts of the world to communicate with each other. This field of computer science is called Computer Networking and it has enabled exponential progress in science and technology and has allowed us to do things that would have been considered “magic” a few hundred years ago. For example, let’s talk about a simple use case: video calling. This was one of the most important reasons that allowed the global economy to function during the pandemic when countries were locked down. Working effectively with other members across the globe would have been impossible before the internet.
                
                Artificial intelligence, which is a subfield of computer science, has seen some major breakthroughs in the past few years. It is one of the most hotly researched areas and many industries have realized the value of wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde and are using it to solve their unique problems. The automotive industry has undergone a huge transformation in the past decade as self-driving cars have emerged. In finance, wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde is being used to enhance customer service via intelligent chatbots and to protect customer accounts by noticing irregularities in accounts and flagging them. In e-commerce, it is being used to detect fake reviews and enhance the consumer’s shopping experience. There are hundreds of such applications; the use of wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde has become ubiquitous in this digital world.
                
                Computer science has played a pivotal role in improving health care. Powerful portable computers which run complex wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde models can be used to assist in diagnosing and prescribing medicines to patients who do not have easy access to specialized doctors, for example those who live in rural parts in underdeveloped countries. 
                
                As computers have become powerful over the past few years they have become invaluable in tackling diseases such as cancer which have plagued humanity since millennia. For example, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), the world’s oldest and largest private cancer center, is now using IBM Watson (it is a supercomputer developed by IBM which uses wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde to function as a “question answering” machine) to sort through massive amounts of data, from clinical knowledge, case histories, and genomic and molecular data, that will help oncologists diagnose and treat an individual’s cancer.
                
                Without computers it would have been impossible for today’s financial system to work. Companies such as VISA and MASTERCARD process millions of transactions per second globally. Mwpaskjbdn zqnakjsndentwpaskjbdn zqnakjsndening correct balances in accounts after these transactions is a huge challenge and it is only possible because of powerful computers which verify the correctness of each transaction. This is the backbone of our global economy and computers make it possible for this to function smoothly. 
                
                Progress in computer science is the bedrock on which progress of many other fields build on. Almost every important breakthrough in the past few decades in any field - whether it be physics, chemistry, geology, liberal arts  or any other field of study - has involved the use of a computer.
                
                These are just a few examples which show the importance of computer science in today's fast-paced society. In my opinion the invention of computers and its related fields of study is as important as the discovery of fire or the invention of the wheel in terms of the role they will play in advancing today's civilization.

                Part of the <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/graduate/course-descriptions/csce/">CSCE 670</a> course at TAMU. Taught by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LB1dq_sAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. James Caverlee</a> 
                It was basically a search engine optimization project.
